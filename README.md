Is this an actual file type? Because if so it is pretty swagging.

So the three sprints that I am going to do: 

First: Get back and generate a map of wikipedia data based on a specific term (Panda)
Second: Get back and generate a map of wikipedia data based on a searchable term (user input)

2.5 Before this I will need to make a decision: should I set this map super convolutedlike? With multiple people to the same one? I feel like I really don't want to, because it seems pretty miserable. But the runtime of searching the array seems pretty difficult as well..... Decisions need to be made!

Third: Get that data to show up on the page using this swag graphing library:
Fourth: Make it so you can click on a datapoint to run the function on it!
Fifth: Get the two way connection thing working
